Most of digital-style watch faces offer a lot of functionality, as well as a huge amount of information presents on a screen. As a result of these, data from their screens can be read with difficulty by people who have limited vision capabilities like me. This watch face allows to read the key personal metrics quick and consciously.

On the other hand the main idea of the watch face design is to have ability read on the screen difference between BMR (https://goo.gl/yZwN7J) and your current burned calories.

I call the feature "Differential BMR Meter". The "Meter" consists of circle and one value shows difference between your basal metabolic rate and the calories for the day. During a day circle changes their state: length of part (arc or line for v√≠voactive HR) is decreasing or growing. The red arc/line shows of unused of your calories in percents relative to the BMR. The orange arc/line gives you to understand: you've already spent more than your BMR but you are not activity enough to burn the fat. The green arc/line shows how much calories was burnt beyond your BMR. At the end of a day you can see estimated value of your activity factor: the longer green arc means the best calories burning result. This one can motivate you to enforce additional activities (to lost weight or body fat burn).

The next thing can help you control your burning calories activity is "activity factor" (AF). If your AF is more than 1.5 of BMR you do good training. The watch face contains bar-graph has 8 AF bars: last 7th days + today. Green bars show well-trained day, red bars shows that on the contrary: you missed the days. A line on the graph gives a view of an average value if AF for the last 8 days. The green line means your week workouts had good activity, red means your should make some efforts and increase your activity.

User settings allow to change colors of accents: hours, colon, minutes, "meter", also you can change place "zero" point of "meter" at 12 or ~14.

The current version presents standard digital watch and week day/month day. You can customize what metrics you want to see at the screen :

1. Differential BMR Meter

2. Daily steps

3. Daily distance

4. Burned calories

5. Altitude

6. Sunrise

7. Sunset

8. Seconds (availability depends on watches models)

9. Heart rate

10. Atmospheric pressure in kPa/hPa/mmHg (except Forerunner 735XT)

11. Temperature (except Forerunner 735XT)

12. Basal metabolic rate

13. Phone connection status

14. Activity Factor of BMR

15. Elevation

16. Floors climbed

17. Activity factor history bar-graph

18. Speed/Cadence in active mode (any training app is launched)

Also you can configure to show some system statuses: battery usage, phone connection or notification icons.

NOTES:

1. Don't forget check configuration of wrist/external heart rate sensor to enable HR field. By default watch has disabled the Wrist Heart Rate Sensor. You can check Settings/Sensors & Accessories/Wrist Heart Rate" and set Status Auto. Also, for instance, if you've already enabled External Heart Rate Sensor it could lead to off the sensor of wrist. Once enabling the sensor you should see HR-vale on the watch screen.

2. After the first update, to make "Sunrise"/"Sunset" available you should launch an app of any outdoor activity like "Walking"/"Running" and wait for connection of GPS/GLONASS.

3. Don't forget change your personal Profile every time when your weight is changing to make measurements of your BMR accuracy.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a settings issue after update, please restart your watches.
